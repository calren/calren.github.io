                    <p> Loved Decision Points, so I was super excited about this book and it didn't disappoint. George W. Bush is one of the best president authors in my opinion, because his books never feel forced or full of political agenda. His display of humor in his books are also a great plus. Great read, and it helped me feel a little more educated about history/politics.</p>

                    <h4>Modern Romance</h4>
                    <p> Was expecting one of those biographies similar to Mindy's or Amy Poehler's, but was pleasantly surprised that this book was actually written based on research findings. Really loved the way Aziz puts in his sense of humor every so often while presenting the facts and numbers. Great quick read.                  </p>

                            <h4>Modern Romance</h4>
                            
                            <p>
                            When I read that Aziz had a book coming out, I decided I needed to treat myself.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            To start, I think anybody contemplating buying the Kindle version should really just spend the extra bucks for the hardcopy, as the book is filled with cool colored pictures and graphs that I think really add to the overall experience. It just wouldn’t be as fun reading on a black and white Kindle.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            That being said, when I first started the book I was expecting another biography similar to that of Mindy Khaling’s or Amy Poehler’s. Just another comedian writing a book about their lives in a humorous way while occasionally doing some name dropping of other famous people.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            I’m glad that ended up not being the case at all. This book was actually written based on numerous research and study group experiments. Aziz teamed up with a renowned sociologist who is an expert in this field to learn as much as he can about modern dating. All of that made up for a very informing read backed by lots of data and interviews with real people. Of course, all this data is presented in an Aziz way - full of humor in the best way possible. Not once did I feel bored about all the numbers that were on the pages, and I found myself laughing out loud a lot every so often from the ridiculous stories Aziz came up with.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Most of the book is focused around online dating and how the current generation is navigating themselves through this new world. Why is it so hard to feel satisfied when there are so many options at our fingertips? How did people even find anybody before with their limited options? What happens after we finally settle on one person? Will we be more satisfied with our choices 20 years in the future?
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            This book tries to answer a lot of those questions by looking at older generations before us and how it eventually evolved to where we are now. Aziz even went to places like Japan, Paris and India to compare the dating cultures there. All of this combined created a very interesting perspective at how different dating can be.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            There were a couple times in the book where I felt like things started to drag on from too much repetition. But never did I feel like the book was a drag to read, and I quickly finished this book within a couple hours of reading time.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            All said and done, definitely take the moment to just treat yoself and read this book. If you don't know much about modern dating, you'll learn about it, and if you think you already know a lot about modern dating, you'll learn how to be better at it and then some.
                            </p>

                    <p> This was on my reading list for a while, but I finally bought it at a bookstore in Seattle. It seemed appropriate to buy it there since the story takes place in Seattle. The book goes back and forth between the past and the present while an elderly man talks about his young love from elementary. Besides being a sucker for these kinds of stories, it was also eye opening for me to think about what Japenese Americans had to go through during WWII.</p>

                            <p>
                            
                            I had played tennis in high school, but the tennis stars that I've been familiar with were people like Federer, Nadal, and Djokivic. So I dived into this book not having any expectations. Despite all that, I was hooked from the first page of when Agassi described in detail the second to last match of his career. His thoughts, emotions, physical well-being, and everything else one can possibly describe.
                            
                             </p>
                             <p>
                            At times I didn't have some trouble believe that he could possibly remember so many details from his life, and the uncanny coincidences that just seeme to happen. But I'll take them whole-heartedly because it makes the story so much more interesting as a whole.
                             </p>
                              <p>
                            Upon finish the book, I proceeded to spend a couple hours watching past Agassi matches on YouTube. Hours well spent.

                    <p> My first Murakami book because I didn't think I would like his Vonnegut-like style. This one, however, really resonated with me. I liked the realism of the story and the way I was able to relate to the characters. A lot of the book focused on what it's like to grow up, gain and lose love, and how sometimes there's not an answer for everything.

                    <h4>Station Eleven</h4>
                    <p> A post-apocalyptic story that isn't really much about life after the apocalyse. I mostly liked the back and forth between the past and the present as the author slowly reveals how the various characters share the same connection.

                            <h4>Station Eleven</h4>
                            
                            <p> This book is on many "Best of 2014" lists, so I figured I should give it a read. Truth be told, I actually had a really hard time getting into the story in the beginning, and wasn't very engrossed until about 80 pages in. I think I was expecting more about how people would survive after the apocalyse, but the book focused more on the survivors' thoughts and memories.</p>
                            
                            <p>The book goes back and forth between life before 99% of the population died, and life after. The center of the story is Authur, a kind of "washed out" actor who has a couple failed marriages, and no real career left. It was hard to care about Authur at first, which is perhaps why I didn't find much of the story interesting. But 1/3 through the book, the story turns to Authur's past, and that's when I finally started caring more about this character and sympathizing with him.</p>
                            
                            <p> Much of the book is spent wondering how everybody is connected, and questioning why certain characters have certain secrets. The ending reveals all of this in an acceptable way, but nothing was too mind-blowing for me. It's like one of those romantic comedies where you realize in the end that everybody's story is strangely entertwined in some way. </p>
                            
                            <p> In the end, I'm not convinced that this is one of the best books of 2014, but I guess it was better than average. I'm also pretty sure there are a bunch of religious comments/references that I completey missed, and perhaps that may have played a part in my under-appreciation of the book in general. </P>

                            <p> I happened upon this book while was at Berkeley's Half Priced Books (one of my favorite bookstores of all time because going there always
                            feels like going on a treasure hunt).</p>
                            
                            <p>To my surprised, this book ended up being a lot more enjoyable that I had anticipated. One of the main reasons was probably because I tend
                            to like the stories that are told through multiple characters. I always thought this type of story telling made stories more interesting because
                            I get to experience the same event mulptiple times, each time with a new persperctive.</p>
                            
                            <p> In this book, the story is told through immigrants young and old, each with their own unique backstories. Come to think of it, it reminds me a lot of
                            the Netflix show, Orange is the New Black, with each chapter devoted to how a character came to be the way they are. </p>
                            
                            <p> Perhaps another reason why I loved this book so much was because i was easily able to relate to it's stories. My parents are also immigrants from
                            Taiwan, and reading about how the older generation had trouble assimiliating into the culture made me think about my own parents and the struggles they must have faced when they first came to America. </P>
                            
                            <p> Despite having fragmented chapters that sometimes didn't contribute to the general plot of the story, the author was still able to craft a very satisfying and thought-provoking ending, which made me love this book even more. </p>

                    on a bit in the end when the author talked more about himself rather than Robert Peace.

                    <p> The beginning of this book went by really fast for me, because all the ideas were so novel. I liked reading about what it's actually like to live in North Korea, and how much propoganda goes on to brainwash the citizens. However, got bored towards the end when everything
                    started to be repetitive.

                    <p> Another WWII story, but this one was just about 2 boys on a bizarre mission of trying to obtain eggs. Loved it for the witty dialogues between the main characters and how the story takes place during the war, but isn't really about the war itself (if that makes any sense). Good short read.

                    <h4>All the Lights We Cannot See</h4>
                    <p> I always like stories about WWII, but this one was special in that it told the story from both sides of the war through a boy who
                    doesn't really want to fight, and a blind girl trying to help defeat the Germans in her own ways. Some people say it's the best book of 2014, but that's a little overrated in my opinion.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Bill Clinton: My Life</h4>
                    <p> Not gonna lie, I didn't finish this ginormous book. I read pretty closely in the first ~100 pages when Bill talked more about his personal life before he got into politics, but once his politics life started, I found it really hard to maintain my interest. Skimmed through the rest.

                    <p>This was a super short book, and I finished it within one sitting at a bookstore. Loved the way the story progressed, the writer's style, and just the general concept of the whole book. Each chapter was a word, followed by a story from the couple that relates to the word.</p>

                    <p>My first introduction to graphic novels, and I really liked the chiller reading pace. The concept of time travelling in the novel was pretty interesting, but I was a little disappointed by the ending. +1 for the awesome graphics. </p>

                    <h4>The Storied Life of AJ Filkry</h4>
                    <p>Easily one of my favorite books of all time. It's a short book and I finished it within a couple hours, but loved every moment so much. The characters were loveable, I LOLed countless times, and the plot has unpredictable turns. The book itself is structured through short stories that AJ picked out, so I wish I read all the short stories before reading each chapter. Will save that for next time.</p>

                    <p>About what goes on in a top security prison, and the thoughts and feelings of the jailmates who try to live life in a lifeless place. Loved how the book was written and the emotional journeys the characters went through. Wish it was longer.</p>

                    <p>Full of depressing moments, as one can tell from the title itself. However, the story was told through the perspective of two different characters, and of course, their story entertwined in the end in one of those "aha!" moments. Also had one of those feel-good endings that's suited for everybody.</p>

                    <p>Really loved The Storyteller, so decided to chose another Jodi Pocult book to read. This one was sadly no where as good, and it felt really dragged on for the most part. About 1/3 through the book I just skimmed the rest to find out what happens in the end.</p>
