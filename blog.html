                On a Sunday spent mostly by myself, I think I actually coded more today than I do at a usual day in work. I tried to make my photo galleries prettier, and it's satisfactory for now. I created some scripts to make all the images one size, and then another script to make thumbnail images. Making thumbnail images was a big harder with all the horizontal and vertical pictures, and not really knowing where to crop the picture in order best represent the picture. Anywho, it's 1AM now and tomorrow is sadly Monday, which means I will have to do some real work. So I guess I'll let it be for now. <p>

                My arms are currently super sore from rock climbing in the afternoon, but since coding doesn't require much movement besides that from the fingers, I've been pretty productive tonight. Tammie made an awesome suggestion about what I should do on my books page, and so I've implemented it tonight! Looks pretty cool if I do say so myself. Now I just need to think of a design for the food page. Tried an awesome place on Friday night and I can't wait to blog about it. Other than that, once I update my travel pages with more pictures, I think the first version of my website will be good to go! <p>

                Building up this site has easily become the highlight of my days, just because it feels so productive to do something instead of loaf around in bed all day.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here are pages that are not ready at all yet:

                <ul>
                <li> Food (don't have any brilliant ideas for the layout yet </li>
                <li> Books (still have some ideas to make the page better </li>
                <li> Side Projects (mostly because I have nothing to showcase....yet) </li>
                <li> Photo Gallery pages: Ideally, my travel pages would link to individual photo pages with many, many pictures. I have a cool idea in mind. </li>
                <li> Drop down menu in nav bar for travel section </li>
                <li> I have a cool idea for building my own photo gallery viewer. Probably need to learn more JavaScript though </li>
                <li> Also, it took me a while to figure out how to efficiently store photos without taking up too much space in my GitHub account. I ended up incorporating DropBox, but it's such a hassle to upload them into Dropbox and then copy and past the image links on my website. So hopefully I can write a script or something that'll automatically generate web pages with pictures and thumbnails whenever I make folders on Dropbox. Cool beans. </li>
                <li> Comments need to be implemented for sure. Althought implementing it might bring me to the sad realization that nobody really visits my site except the people that have been forced to observe my progress. </li>
                </ul>
                
                Okay, so basically nothing is really complete yet except the home page, and the trave home page.
                
                </p>
                
                <p> Still stoked. </p>
                
                <p> UPDATE: Felt extra inspired tonight and finished photo gallery implementation as well. Woooooo. Just need to add more pictures to spice things up now. </p>

                One day while I was just loafing around in bed, I realized that I have absoutely nothing in my public GitHub account. So I set on to brainstorm some ideas about projects I could possibly pursue. It somehow struck me that I've always wanted to create my own website, but always thought that I didn't have the necessary skills to make something that didn't look too lame. I assumed that technology had advanced enough that even someone like me could be able to build something relatively easily. Voila! Here is the result. This site will probably forever be a work in progress, but I'm excited about all the possiblities.
