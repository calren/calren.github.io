                    <h1> Christmas Coding </h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> December 23, 2015</p>
                    <hr>
                    
                    <p>
                    This is jumping ahead a bit, but I'm pretty proud of the exercises I came up with for the class before Christmas, so I wanted to blog about it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    At this point, the students had learned some major concepts in Java such as primitives, if/else conditions, for/while loops and arrays. We had been going over arrays for the past few weeks, but I had a feeling that it wasn't really sticking with the students.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Being that it was the week before Christmas, and that I'm a giant Christmas fan, I wanted to create some exercises that day to celebrate. These are some of the things I came up with.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    1. Write a method that takes in an int, and prints out a Christmas tree with the int number of levels.
                    So for example, if the method called was printChristmasTree(10), it would print out something like this.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <img align="middle" src="tree.png">
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Basically a Christmas tree with 10 layers, and then a little stand at the bottom. If they had extra time, they could try implementing it with ornaments where some X's are O's instead.
                    This problem required knowing the difference between System.out.print and System.out.println, and also having a really good grasp of for loops. Unfortunately, a lot of students strugged with this one, but was able to solve it in the end after hints along the way. I've found that it's a great strategy to present the whole problem first, give the students some time to think about it, and then present hints every 15 minutes so they don't get too frustrated and quit at any point.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        The second project I gave them involved using arrays, for loops, and basic coding skills.
                        The README for the project looks like this.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       <code style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
                        /*
                        * We're going to create a game for users to get a chance at getting a
                        * present. We start with an array with 20 elements, and 3 of these
                        * elements will represent presents. The rest of the elements
                        * will be represent coal
                        *
                        * At the beginning of the game, the program chooses
                        * 3 random array elements to be presents
                        *
                        * The user then gets 3 chances to get one or multiple presents. For each
                        * attempt the user has, they chose a random number between 1 to 20.
                        * If they were lucky and chose an array element that was a present,
                        * they win a present
                        *
                        *
                        * For bonus: we can chose 3 random array elements to be presents, and
                        * also have 2 random array elements to be a TRY AGAIN. so if the user
                        * chooses one of the TRY AGAIN elements, they should get another chance
                        * and not lose an attempt
                        */
                        </code>

                    <p>
                    Throughout the class itself, I had a lot of TODOs for the students to fill in. This was a good practice for them in reviewing arrays and keeping track of variables.

                    <h1> Drawing with for loops </h1>

                    <p>
                    One of the favorite activities of the class involves using the java drawing library gpdraw. It's pretty easy to use, and could be learned in a few minutes after some explaining. It's also incredibly satisfying to be able to visually see what you've created with your code. We used this library in class on the first day to draw a simple house. This required nothing more than learning to how to call functions, and the importance of giving functions arguments.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    As we were learning for-loops, an exercise that I came up with involved drawing a colorful sun using a for loop. The program consisted of drawing 360 lines from the center as "spokes". In the end, it would look something like this.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img align="middle" src="sun.png">
                        
                    The colors were achieved with the java.awt.Color library, and by using a different color to draw a line on random iterations of the for loop.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    The class really had a lot of fun with this one, as students always love customizing their programs to look unique and cool. Some students were even able to come up with some really cool designs using some magic with the for loop.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Now that I think about it, getting the job was probably the easiest part of this whole thing. As the first day of class started quickly approaching, I began to realize how much I needed to prepare.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    What kind of teacher would I be? The harsh and strict one that nobody really likes but always has a quiet classroom? Or the chill and easy-going kind that doesn't always have the most controlled students. Should I introduce myself as Ms. Chang? Or would that be ridiculous because some people still mistake me as a high school student? Should we do some ice-breakers so I can get to know the students? Or is that not a thing for high schoolers anymore... The last time I had been in a high school classroom was more than 7 years ago, and I didn't really remember what it felt like besides always being tired.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    To add on to my stress, I was out celebrating a friend's birthday till 3am that Friday night (or should I say Saturday morning). I set my alarm for 7am the next day, and tried not to stress out too much.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    The next morning, I woke up at 6am, too anxious to sleep more. I got myself a large Starbucks before heading my way, thinking it would get me more energized (I never drink coffee regularly). That morning I ended up arriving at class more than an hour early. I sat there in my classroom, just letting everything sink in a bit. I was going to be teaching in one of the rooms in Soda Hall, the same building I had taken my computer courses while I was in college. Wow, what am I going to say to these kids...
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    The rest of the day went by in pretty much a blur. We did some introductory coding questions, I let the kids figure out some sorting algorithms with playing cards, and they drew pictures of houses using some of the drawing functions in Java. All the students seemed like they had a great time, and I felt feeling a little more confident.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    In retrospect, it was surprising how easy everything came along. I didn't nervous at all once class started. Things progressed naturally, and I felt like I had a command of the classroom without even knowing how I did it. After I left class that day, I felt a natural high.
                    </p>

                    <h1> Finding an Opportunity </h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> December 10, 2015</p>

                    <p>
                    I have been interested in teaching since middle school. Whenever I need to find a job to make some money, I always thought the best opportunities were tutoring and teaching kids.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    However, when I entered the adult life and started working full time, I forgot what it meant to do things outside of work that wasn't just hanging out with friends or chilling in bed. I would occasionally pick up a few day opportunities here and there, but I never enjoyed them that much because I felt like the opportunities weren't long enough for me to make a real connection with the kids I was worked with. It's hard to fee the impact and progress when you only see someone once a week.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        About 3 years after graduating college, I decided that I really missed being in the classroom and interecting with students on a regular basis. So I decided to search the interweb and see what kind of opportunities were out there. Lo and behold, I happened upon the most perfect position for me. It was a AP Computer Science instructor position that would happen once a week on Saturdays. This was perfect for 2 main reasons. One, I'm an Android developer so I work all day with Java. AP Computer Science also happens to be taught in Java. Two, I always found commitments on weekdays to be harder since I still have a full-time job. Having this opportunity on the weekend would really allow me to still focus on my day job while also being able to spend some time teaching on the weekends. I rarely do anything productive on Saturday mornings anyway.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I applied, knowing that I was probably way too inexperienced, but hoping for the best. The position was also posted to start 3 days after I submitted my application, so I hnoestly didn't have high expectations. Luckily, the organization hadn't found a suitable candidate for the position yet, and after some phone calls and magic happenings, I was offered the position.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        At this point, I would say this was probably the most exciting job offer I've ever received.
                    </p>
