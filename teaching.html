                    <h1> First day of class </h1>

                    <p>
                    Now that I think about it, getting the job was probably the easiest part of this whole thing. As the first day of class started quickly approaching, I began to realize how much I needed to prepare.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    What kind of teacher would I be? The harsh and strict one that nobody really likes but always has a quiet classroom? Or the chill and easy-going kind that doesn't always have the most controlled students. Should I introduce myself as Ms. Chang? Or would that be ridiculous because some people still mistake me as a high school student? Should we do some ice-breakers so I can get to know the students? Or is that not a thing for high schoolers anymore... The last time I had been in a high school classroom was more than 7 years ago, and I didn't really remember what it felt like besides always being tired.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    To add on to my stress, I was out celebrating a friend's birthday till 3am that Friday night (or should I say Saturday morning). I set my alarm for 7am the next day, and tried not to stress out too much.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    The next morning, I woke up at 6am, too anxious to sleep more. I got myself a large Starbucks before heading my way, thinking it would get me more energized (I never drink coffee regularly). That morning I ended up arriving at class more than an hour early. I sat there in my classroom, just letting everything sink in a bit. I was going to be teaching in one of the rooms in Soda Hall, the same building I had taken my computer courses while I was in college. Wow, what am I going to say to these kids...
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    The rest of the day went by in pretty much a blur. We did some introductory coding questions, I let the kids figure out some sorting algorithms with playing cards, and they drew pictures of houses using some of the drawing functions in Java. All the students seemed like they had a great time, and I felt feeling a little more confident.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    In retrospect, it was surprising how easy everything came along. I didn't nervous at all once class started. Things progressed naturally, and I felt like I had a command of the classroom without even knowing how I did it. After I left class that day, I felt a natural high.
                    </p>

                    <h1> Finding an Opportunity </h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> December 10, 2015</p>

                    <p>
                    I have been interested in teaching since middle school. Whenever I need to find a job to make some money, I always thought the best opportunities were tutoring and teaching kids.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    However, when I entered the adult life and started working full time, I forgot what it meant to do things outside of work that wasn't just hanging out with friends or chilling in bed. I would occasionally pick up a few day opportunities here and there, but I never enjoyed them that much because I felt like the opportunities weren't long enough for me to make a real connection with the kids I was worked with. It's hard to fee the impact and progress when you only see someone once a week.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        About 3 years after graduating college, I decided that I really missed being in the classroom and interecting with students on a regular basis. So I decided to search the interweb and see what kind of opportunities were out there. Lo and behold, I happened upon the most perfect position for me. It was a AP Computer Science instructor position that would happen once a week on Saturdays. This was perfect for 2 main reasons. One, I'm an Android developer so I work all day with Java. AP Computer Science also happens to be taught in Java. Two, I always found commitments on weekdays to be harder since I still have a full-time job. Having this opportunity on the weekend would really allow me to still focus on my day job while also being able to spend some time teaching on the weekends. I rarely do anything productive on Saturday mornings anyway.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I applied, knowing that I was probably way too inexperienced, but hoping for the best. The position was also posted to start 3 days after I submitted my application, so I hnoestly didn't have high expectations. Luckily, the organization hadn't found a suitable candidate for the position yet, and after some phone calls and magic happenings, I was offered the position.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        At this point, I would say this was probably the most exciting job offer I've ever received.
                    </p>
